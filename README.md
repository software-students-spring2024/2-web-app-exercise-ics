# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Run Instructions

#### `.env` file:

See the Discord channel for Team-ICS to get the `.env` file. Place the file in the root directory.

Note: Discord converts the `.env` file to a `env` file, so make sure you rename the downloaded file to `.env`.

#### To run:

Create a virtual environment, and/or install from `requirements.txt`.

Run `python flask_app.py`.

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
